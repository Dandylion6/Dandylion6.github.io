*Daan Osterloh*

## About Me
Welcome! My name is Daan Osterloh. I'm half Thai and half Dutch. I love to make cool stuff, whether it is code, 3D models, digital art, or even forging with hot metal. I even have a small blacksmith workshop where I tinker in as a hobby. As a programmer at heart, I aim to develop games that blend technical precision while expressing my own artistic vision. It's clear to me—and hopefully to you by the end of this—that I am passionate about game development and driven to bring worlds to life thorugh my skills and creativity.

## How I got here
Here's a quick run-down on my game development journey and my experience with various tools.
- 2020-2022: It all began with me trying to make games using *Roblox Studio* which tought me the basics of programming.
- 2022-2024: I transitioned to the *Unity Engine* for game development, learning *C#* and how to properly structure a real game.
- 2023: I gained brief industry experience at *Ticket Counter*, developing their QR app for Apple devices using the *Swift* programming language.
- 2024-2025: Alongside Unity I expanded to using *C++* for building games using libraries without relying on a engine. This tought me how game engines work under the hood and gave me flexibility in designing my games.

## My work
To show that I'm not all talk, here I will showcase my projects, the skills I've learned along the way, the challenges I've faced, and some up-and-coming stuff. Each piece should reflect my growth as a programmer, artist, and above all as a game developer. I will showcase anything worth your time, this includes unfinished projects as well.
