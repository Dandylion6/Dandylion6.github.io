  <h2>üß≠ About Me</h2>
  <p>
 Welcome! My name is Daan Osterloh. I'm half Thai and half Dutch. I love to make cool stuff, whether it is code, 3D models, digital art, or even forging with hot metal. I even have a small blacksmith workshop where I tinker in as a hobby. As a programmer at heart, I aim to develop games that blend technical precision while expressing my own artistic vision. It's clear to me‚Äîand hopefully to you by the end of this‚Äîthat I am passionate about game development and driven to bring worlds to life through my skills and creativity.

## üïπÔ∏è How I Got Here  
Here's a quick run-down on my game development journey and my experience with various tools.  

- **2020‚Äì2022:** It all began with me trying to make games using *Roblox Studio*, which taught me the basics of programming.  
- **2022‚Äì2024:** I transitioned to the *Unity Engine* for game development, learning *C#* and how to properly structure a real game.  
- **2023:** I gained brief industry experience at *Ticket Counter*, developing their QR app for Apple devices using the *Swift* programming language.  
- **2024‚Äì2025:** Alongside Unity, I expanded to using *C++* for building games using libraries without relying on an engine. This let me experience how game engines work under the hood and gave me flexibility in designing my games.

## üî® What I've Done  
To show that I'm not all talk, here I will showcase my projects, the skills I've learned along the way, the challenges I've faced, and some up-and-coming stuff. Each piece should reflect my growth as a programmer, artist, and above all as a game developer. I will showcase anything worth your time‚Äîthis includes unfinished projects as well.

### üß≠ C++ Trading Game MVP  
[![Gameplay Demo](images/Per_The_Contract_Thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/5NnvE85OU7s)  
*Click the thumbnail to see the demo video!*  

Created using **C++** and the *SFML* library for rendering, this project was developed as an intake assignment. If you are interested in peeking under the hood, [here](https://github.com/Dandylion6/Per-The-Contract) you can find the repository of the project, or [here](https://dandylion6.itch.io/per-the-contract) for a playable copy. This project took a lot of effort to get working as it is my first ever time developing a game without an engine as well as with C++, yet I managed to wrap it all up within 3 months.

### üïπÔ∏è Untitled Platformer  
![Gameplay GIF](gifs/24-09-2022.gif)  

One of the first Unity projects I developed. Wanting to make a satisfying and responsive movement system for this platformer, I studied methods to achieve this. It never was more than just the movement and camera code-wise.

*Click the thumbnail to see the demo video!*  

This project was made for the 2023 *Cozy Spring* Game Jam‚Äîit is the first time I participated in one. It lasted for three whole days, where me and a friend of mine developed this game from scratch. My friend was responsible for the models while I did everything else. The build can be found [here](https://dandylion6.itch.io/natures-harvest) if you are interested in trying this out.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Current Project

*Click the thumbnail to see the demo video!*  

A little sneak peek at a side project I am working on in my free time. It uses **C++** with *Raylib* and *EnTT* libraries as the backbone. *EnTT* is perfect for creating an ECS game structure, which is more modern and optimized than OOP. *Raylib* is used for rendering and audio. Due to it being an ongoing project, with release in mind, I unfortunately will not have the repository public.
