*Daan Osterloh*

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Daan Osterloh. I'm half Thai and half Dutch. ’ve always felt connected to the creative world, especially within the gaming industry. I love to make cool stuff, whether it is code, 3D models, digital art, or even forging with hot metal. At home, I even have a small blacksmith wprkshop where I tinker in as a hobby. As a programmer at heart, I aim to develop games that blend technical precision while expressing my own artistic vision. It's clear to me—and hopefully to you by the end of this—that I am passionate about game development and driven to bring worlds to life thorugh my skills and creativity.
